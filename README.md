# E-Commerce Microservices

This repository contains microservices that together form a small e-commerce platform. Services are containerised with Docker and share a single PostgreSQL instance using a schema-per-service model.

## Architecture

- **Services**:
  - **Catalog** – manages products under `services/Catalog`.
  - **Order** – handles customer orders under `services/Order`.

## Gateway

All services are exposed through a single Kong Gateway container. Requests share the `/api/v1/` prefix and are routed according to `services/Gateway/kong.yml`. The gateway applies authentication, ACL-based authorisation, rate limiting and Prometheus metrics. Stress test endpoints with [`hey`](https://github.com/rakyll/hey), for example:

```bash
hey -z 30s http://localhost/api/v1/catalog/products
```


## Building and Running

From the `services` directory you can spin up the entire stack:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Run a single service for local testing using its Docker Compose file:

```bash
cd services/<ServiceName>
docker compose up --build
```
When using the Security service, the Gradle wrapper JAR is downloaded
automatically on first run. Simply execute `./gradlew` in `services/Security`.
